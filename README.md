# React Tic Tac Toe

In this project, I followed react tutorial by doing and made a tic tac toe game which let you play and jump to the previous moves. The [react.dev](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) is very interesting way to learn react and play around it.
Check my code. Install it and Play along
For the future I'm gonna modify it and make it two-payer which you can play on different devices.
